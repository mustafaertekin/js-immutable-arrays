So you have a train travelling through many cities called "Passengers" (in "js/passengers.js"). Every person in this train is somehow related at least to another one. While the train was going through the cities, something is happend: The engineman was murdered! An investigator has been immediately assigned by the local government to find the murderer. The first thing, he does, was having locked all the doors. He does not let the passengers go before the investigation process is finished.

The investigator has many questions about the passengers. So you need to help him by writing appropriate functions (in "js/chapters/chapter-xx.js") for finding the murderer.

You need to help the investigator in his enquiry. You have to implement (write) the body of the functions below properly. Any error in your function reduces dramatically the health of the investigation. So be carefull with your code, this is very vital because the murderer is still in the train!!!!!

### Notes:
- The tests are in the file "js/tests.js". You do not need to change any code in the test file!
- The tests need the functions in the file "js/chapter-xx.js" to be implemented. 
- You can find the passenger list and all related information in the file "js/passengers.js". Please provide the right implementations using the array "Passengers".
